Sure 🙂 let’s do this purely with numbers, very simple, no jargon.

Step 1: Pool starts empty
Assume an LST protocol (on Solana).
Total SOL in pool = 0 SOL
Total LST tokens = 0 LST   
Step 2: User deposits SOL
User A deposits 100 SOL
Protocol mints LST at a 1:1 rate at the start.
Total SOL in pool = 100 SOL
Total LST supply = 100 LST
So:
1 LST = 1 SOL
User A owns:
100 LST

Step 3: Staking rewards come in
Assume after some time:
Validators earn 10 SOL as rewards
Now:
Total SOL in pool = 110 SOL
Total LST supply = still 100 LST (no new LST minted)
New exchange rate:
1 LST = 110 / 100 = 1.10 SOL
User A still has:
100 LST
But value is now:
100 LST × 1.10 = 110 SOL

✅ Value increased without minting more LST

Step 4: New user deposits later
User B deposits 55 SOL
Minting must be fair, so LST is minted at current rate:
Minted LST = 55 / 1.10 = 50 LST

Now totals:
Total SOL = 165 SOL
Total LST = 150 LST
Exchange rate:
165 / 150 = 1.10 SOL per LST
No one is diluted.

Step 5: More rewards come in
Later, staking earns 15 SOL more.
Now:
Total SOL = 180 SOL
Total LST = 150 LST
New rate:
1 LST = 180 / 150 = 1.20 SOL
User values:
User A: 100 × 1.20 = 120 SOL
User B: 50 × 1.20 = 60 SOL

Step 6: What if something bad happens (slashing)?
Assume a 5 SOL slash happens.
Now:
Total SOL = 175 SOL
Total LST = 150 LST
New rate:
1 LST = 175 / 150 = 1.1667 SOL

❌ Exchange rate decreased:
from 1.20 → 1.1667 SOL

User A value:
100 × 1.1667 ≈ 116.67 SOL
Step 7: Market price vs true value (important)
Even if:
True value = 1 LST = 1.1667 SOL

On a DEX it could trade at:
1.14 SOL (discount)
1.18 SOL (premium)
That’s trading behavior, not staking math.

Key takeaway (one line)
LST value = Total SOL in pool / Total LST supply
Rewards → increase SOL → value goes up
Slashing / loss → decrease SOL → value goes down
LST count usually stays fixed



what happens when user unstaked, the LST tokens are burned or like somethignelse
Great follow-up 👍
Yes — LST tokens are effectively burned when a user unstakes, but how that happens depends on which unstaking path is used. Let’s explain it with clear math and flow.

Two ways to unstake an LST on Solana
1️⃣ Native unstake (burn → wait → receive SOL)
This is the protocol-level unstake.
2️⃣ Instant unstake (sell on DEX)
This is a market trade, not real unstaking.

I’ll explain both.

1️⃣ Native unstake (LST is burned)
Starting state
From our earlier example:
Total SOL in pool = 180 SOL
Total LST supply = 150 LST

Exchange rate:
1 LST = 180 / 150 = 1.20 SOL
User A holds:
100 LST
User A unstakes 20 LST
Protocol calculates how much SOL this represents:
20 LST × 1.20 = 24 SOL

What happens internally:
✅ 20 LST are burned
❌ They no longer exist
But SOL is still staked, so:
User must wait for the Solana unstake cooldown (≈ 2–3 days)
Pool state after burn (but before withdrawal)
Total LST = 130 LST
SOL is reserved for User A (24 SOL)
Remaining SOL backing active LST = 156 SOL
Exchange rate stays the same:
156 / 130 = 1.20 SOL

👉 Burning keeps everyone else undiluted
After cooldown completes
User A receives:
24 SOL
System is now consistent.

2️⃣ Instant unstake (selling LST on a DEX)
Here, nothing is burned.
User:
Sells 20 LST on a DEX
Gets SOL from another trader

What changes?
Total SOL in protocol = unchanged
Total LST supply = unchanged
Ownership of LST shifts to someone else

📉 Price may be:
Slightly lower than intrinsic value (liquidity fee)
Or higher (demand)
But protocol math is unaffected.

Side-by-side summary
Action	LST burned?	SOL leaves pool?	Wait time
Native unstake	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	~2–3 days
DEX sell	❌ No	❌ No	Instant

Why burning is necessary
If LST were not burned:
SOL would leave the pool
Same LST would represent less SOL
Remaining holders would be diluted ❌
Burning keeps this formula correct:
LST value = Total SOL / Total LST

Final mental model (very important)
Think of LST as shares of a vault:
Deposit SOL → mint shares
Rewards → vault grows
Unstake → burn shares → withdraw vault assets
